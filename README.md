The Cybersecurity Chatbot is a console-based interactive assistant developed in C# to help users learn about key cybersecurity concepts in a friendly and personalized manner. Upon launch, the chatbot greets the user with a colorful welcome banner, asks for their name, and prompts them to enter their favorite cybersecurity topic. It then engages the user in a dialogue where they can ask questions related to cybersecurity, such as passwords, phishing, privacy, and malware. The chatbot responds with randomized informative tips tailored to the recognized topic, while also detecting sentiments like curiosity, frustration, or worry to offer encouraging replies. Users can type "more" to receive additional information on the last discussed topic, or type "exit" to quit the application. The program uses C# delegates to structure the interaction logic, supports colored console output for improved readability, and remembers previous interactions for a more dynamic experience. This chatbot is a great tool for beginners to explore cybersecurity awareness in a fun and engaging way.
